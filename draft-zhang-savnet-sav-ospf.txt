                   draft-zhang-savnet-sav-ospf-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a comprehensive intra-domain Source Address
   Validation (SAV) solution to deal with different source address
   spoofing scenarios.  It can be applied to networks running OSPFv2 and
   OSPFv3.  The Source Prefix Validation Sub-TLV is defined to support
   automatic SAV-specific information exchanging between area-local
   routers, which helps routers generate accurate SAV rules to verify
   the validity of data packets.

1.  Introduction

   In the realm of network security, the authenticity of packet sources
   stands as a fundamental pillar.  Source address spoofing, wherein an
   attacker deceives a network by masquerading as a legitimate user,
   poses severe risks including but not limited to identity theft,
   unauthorized network access, and the facilitation of denial-of-
   service (DoS) attacks.  Such activities compromise the integrity of
   data, disrupt service operations, and erode the trust in network
   communications.

   Implementing robust source address validation (SAV) mechanisms within
   domains is crucial for mitigating these threats.  Representative
   existing solutions for intra-domain source address validation include
   ACL-based ingress filtering[RFC2827][RFC3704], Strict uRPF[RFC3704],
   etc.  However, as analyzed in [intra-domain-ps], these mechanisms
   often suffer from high operational overhead and limitations in their
   accuracy, leading to potential mismanagement and false positives in
   dynamic network environments.

   To address these shortcomings, the Intra-domain Source Address
   Validation (SAVNET) Architecture[intra-domain-arch] proposes a
   framework that use both local routing information and SAV-specific
   information exchanged among routers to achieve accurate SAV in an
   intra-domain network by an automatic way.

   This document follows the Intra-domain SAVNET architecture and delves
   into the SAV mechanisms that can be implemented in OSPF networks to
   address various intra-domain source address spoofing scenarios.
   These mechanisms leverage either routing information from the LSDB or
   SAV-specific information from other routers to achieve accurate and
   automated SAV.  A new Source Prefix Validation Sub-TLV is defined to
   enable the exchange of SAV-specific information among OSPF routers.
   It equips routers with the capability to recognize all the legitimate
   ingress interfaces a source prefix might reach along its actual
   forwarding paths—paths not only defined by routing protocols but also
   specified by network administrators based on policies.  Routers can
   use the accurate information they possess to prevent both the
   erroneous blocking of legitimate traffic and the spread of spoofed
   traffic within a network domain.

   OSPF networks can fully or partially implement these SAV mechanisms
   as needed to achieve the following objectives:

   *  Outbound traffic validation: prevent packets with spoofed source
      addresses generated by the stub networks from entering or moving
      within the domain.

   *  Inbound traffic validation: prevent packets spoofing the domain’s
      own source addresses originating from other domains from entering
      the domain.

3.  Source Address Validation in OSPF Networks

3.1.  Overview

   In networks utilizing either OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 protocols, routers
   positioned at different locations within the network should undertake
   varying responsibilities in source address validation, collectively
   contributing to effective outbound and inbound traffic validation.
   Different validation modes as described in [sav-table] can be used in
   different scenarios as explained below.

   *  *Edge Source Address Validation (Edge SAV)*

      Edge routers connected directly to stub networks are pivotal as
      starting points for traffic entering the intra-domain network.
      Performing SAV at these points ensures the legitimacy of outbound
      traffic’s source addresses right at the entry.  If an edge router
      is aware of all prefixes of the connected stub network and is
      capable of implementing SAV, these prefixes should be added to an
      allowlist at the interface connected to the stub network.  Packets
      originating from the stub network with source addresses matching
      the allowlist should be normally forwarded, while others should be
      blocked, thus preventing spoofed source address packets from
      entering the domain at their origin.

   *  *Transit Source Address Validation (Transit SAV)*

      Ensuring that all edge routers support Edge SAV might be
      challenging in a network environment composed of multi-vendor
      devices managed by different operations teams, due to differences
      in resource investment and technical capalilities.  Full
      deployment of Edge SAV could be a long-term process in such a
      situation.  If not all edge routers can achieve accurate Edge SAV,
      packets with spoofed source addresses from stub networks might
      still appear within the domain.  Under such circumstances, transit
      routers, responsible for forwarding packets, can perform source
      address validation during packet transit, further ensuring the
      authenticity of traffic forwarded in the domain.

   *  *Area Border Source Address Validation (Area Border SAV)*

      In large networks utilizing the OSPF protocol, an Autonomous
      System (AS) may be divided into multiple areas.  To prevent
      routing loops in multi-area scenarios, traffic between non-
      backbone areas is typically routed through the backbone area,
      rather than crossing a third non-backbone area.  Packets received
      at the Area Border Router (ABR) interfaces connected to a specific
      area should only have source addresses belonging to that area and
      not from other areas.  It is practical for an ABR to add the
      prefixes advertised to that area in summary LSAs to a SAV
      blocklist at the interfaces connected to that specific area.  This
      prevents inter-area source address spoofing by blocking packets
      whose source addresses matches this blocklist.

   *  *AS Border Source Address Validation (AS Border SAV)*

      AS Border Routers (ASBRs) are gateways through which external
      traffic enters the domain.  ASBRs can discern the prefix of their
      own AS through router-LSAs and summary-LSAs.  By adding these
      prefixes to a blocklist at interfaces connecting to other ASs,
      packets from other ASs with source addresses matching this
      blocklist can be blocked, thereby preventing spoofed traffic from
      entering the domain.

   For Edge SAV, Area Border SAV, and AS Border SAV, routers can
   establish interface-based prefix allowlists or blocklists either
   manually or based on the local LSDB.  For Transit SAV, routers should
   be aware of the valid incoming interfaces for a given source prefix
   in order to establish a prefix-based interface allowlist.  Packets
   with source addresses matching this source prefix are normally
   forwarded only when their incoming interfaces are in the allowlist.
   Otherwise, they should be processed according to predefined security
   policies, which may include actions like packet dropping or rate
   limiting.  If the source address of a packet does not match any
   recorded source prefix, the packet is considered valid by default.

3.2.  Use Cases

   For intra-domain networks, source address spoofing primarily occurs
   in the following scenarios: Firstly, a stub network within the domain
   might spoof the source addresses of other networks, which could be
   those within the same area, other areas within the domain, or even
   other ASes.  Secondly, packets from other ASes spoofing the source
   addresses of a domain might enter this domain.  This section uses
   Figure 1 as an example to comprehensively demonstrate the typical
   scenarios of intra-domain source address spoofing and explain how to
   effectively implement intra-domain SAV using the approaches proposed
   in Section 3.1.

               Figure 1: Intra-domain SAVNET Use Cases

   Figure 1 shows a domain AS1 with two areas, namely the backbone area
   Area0 and non-backbone area Area1.  ABR R6 connects Area0 and Area1,
   and ASBR R9 connects AS1 and AS2.  First, let’s consider the
   scenarios where stub networks of R3 and R5 in Area1 spoof the source
   addresses of other networks.  We will show how routers in Area1 can
   use source address verification to identify the spoofed traffic.

   *Use Case 1: Edge SAV.* Suppose R3 knows its connected subnet's
   address range is 10.3.0.0/16.  R3 can add the prefix 10.3.0.0/16 to
   the SAV whitelist at the interface connecting this subnet.  Then
   packets originating from the subnet will only be forwarded by R3 if
   their source addresses belong to 10.3.0.0/16.  Packets spoofing the
   source addresses of other networks will be prevented from entering
   the network at R3.

   *Use Case 2: Transit SAV.* Assume R5 does not support SAV due to
   hardware/software capability limitations or performance
   considerations.  Routers R1-R4 and R6 in Area1 can check whether the
   packets from R5 spoof the source address of another network by
   learning the valid incoming interfaces for packets from that network.
   Specifically, three types of spoofed source address packets might
   enter the network through R5:

   1.  Packets from R5 spoofing other network prefixes within the same
       area (e.g., 10.1.0.0/16 of R1).  If R2, R3, R4 and R6 learn that
       the legitimate incoming interfaces for 10.1.0.0/16 are the
       interfaces corresponding to links R1-R2, R1-R3, R2-R4 and R4-R6
       separately, then spoofed traffic from R5 entering R2, R3, and R6
       through links R5-R3, R5-R2, and R5-R6 can be blocked by these
       transit routers.

   2.  Packets from R5 spoofing prefixes of Area0 (e.g., 10.8.0.0/16 of
       R8).  Assume R4, R2 and R1 learn that the legitimate incoming
       interfaces for 10.8.0.0/16 are the interfaces corresponding to
       links R6-R4, R4-R2 and R2-R1 separately.  Then spoofed traffic
       from R5 entering R4, R2 and R1 through paths R5-R3-R4, R5-R2, and
       R5-R3-R1 can be blocked.

   3.  Packets from R5 spoofing prefixes of AS2 (e.g., 20.0.0.0/8).
       Similar to the second scenario, if R4, R2 and R1 learn that the
       legitimate incoming interfaces for 20.0.0.0/8 are the interfaces
       corresponding to links R6-R4, R4-R2 and R2-R1 separately, then
       spoofed traffic from R5 entering R4, R2, and R1 through paths
       R5-R3-R4, R5-R2, R5-R3-R1 can be blocked.

   *Use Case 3: Area Border SAV.* ABR R6 advertises Area0's routing
   prefixes to Area1 through Type 3 LSAs, including the prefix
   10.8.0.0/16.  R6 can establish a SAV blacklist for these prefixes at
   its interfaces connecting to Area1.  If packets received at these
   interfaces have source addresses that hit the SAV blacklist, such as
   packets from R5 to R6 spoofing 10.8.0.0/16, they can be blocked by
   R6.

   Next, we look at how ASBR R9 identifies spoofed traffic from AS2
   spoofing AS1's source addresses when it reaches R9.

   *Use Case 4: AS Border SAV.* R9 can obtain AS1's routing prefixes
   through Type 1 and Type 3 LSAs and establish a SAV blacklist at its
   interfaces connecting to AS2.  If packets received at these
   interfaces have source addresses that hit the SAV blacklist, such as
   packets from R20 to R9 spoofing 10.1.0.0/16, they can be blocked by
   R9.

   In summary, an intra-domain network can customize its SAV solutions
   based on specific network environments and security requirements.  It
   can flexibly activate various SAV modes on different routers, such as
   Edge SAV only, a combination of Edge SAV, Area Border SAV, and AS
   Border SAV, or Edge SAV and Transit SAV.  This ensures that the
   solution is not only effective but also tailored to the actual
   circumstances of the network.

4.  Solution to Transit SAV

   For Transit SAV, a router must be aware of all the valid incoming
   interfaces for a source prefix to avoid improper blocking of packets
   with legitimate source addresses.  In OSPF networks, packets are
   typically forwarded along the paths specified by the Shortest Path
   Tree (SPT).  However, if a router has enabled Policy-Based Routing
   (PBR), the packets will be preferentially forwarded to the next hop
   as designated by the PBR rules.  Thus, an effective way to implement
   Transit SAV is for the router owning that source prefix to
   proactively send SAV messages to other routers.  The messages should
   inform the routers about which interfaces packets matching that
   source prefix will reach along the actual forwarding paths, including
   those determined by the routing protocol and those specified by PBR.
   To accomplish this, a router can generate a SAV message for a
   protected source prefix, specifying the neighboring router to receive
   the message and the destination routers to which the message will be
   ultimately advertised.  The SAV message propagates along the actual
   forwarding path of the source prefix.  Routers receiving a SAV
   message through an interface recognize that interface as valid for
   the source prefix conveyed in the message.  Based on the received SAV
   messages, routers can establish a prefix-based interface allowlist
   (see [sav-table]) for data-plane SAV filtering.

   A SAV message should at least include the following fields:

   Message Type (MT)
      Distinguishes SAV messages based on the kind of routing
      information used to generate the message.  'S' means the message
      is generated based on SPT.  'P' means the message is generated
      based on PBR rules.

   Source Router ID (SR)
      The identifier of the router that generated the message.

   Source Prefix (SP)
      The source prefix that the message seeks to protect.

   Neighbor Router ID (NR)
      The identifier of the neighbor router to which the message is
      sent.

   Destination Router ID (DR)
      The destination router's identifier, to which the message is
      ultimately advertised.

   Destination Prefix (DP)
      The destination prefix to which the message is ultimately
      advertised.

   Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 respectively elaborate on the generation
   and propagation of SAV messages in scenarios only involving
   conventional routing and those with PBR enabled.  The format of each
   field in a SAV message is specific to the OSPF version used, which
   will be explained in Section 5.

   Transit SAV is applicable to both single-area and multi-area
   scenarios within a domain.  In multi-area scenarios, the SAV messages
   generated by routers are propagated only within their respective
   areas.

4.1.  SAV Message Propagation based on SPT

   This section describes how intra-domain routers generate and
   propagate SAV messages based on the local Shortest Path Tree (SPT)
   and establish SAV rules.  Figure 2 shows an intra-domain network
   running the OSPF protocol.  The SPT of Router R1 is shown in
   Figure 3.  Packets originating from R1, with a source address within
   the subnet 10.1.0.0/16, are forwarded along this SPT path.  The SAV
   message generated by R1 should be propagated along the SPT to all
   leaf node routers, carrying the prefix 10.1.0.0/16.  All routers
   along the path can then receive the message and establish local SAV
   rules for this prefix.  Similarly, ABRs and ASBRs can send SAV
   messages along the SPT to other routers within the area.  These
   messages carry prefixes from other areas or ASes, enabling the
   routers to establish SAV rules for these prefixes.

   Specifically, the SPT of R1 includes leaf nodes R3, R5, and R6, with
   R3 directly connected to R1, while R5 and R6 are in the subtree of
   neighbor R2.  R1 needs to generate SAV messages for neighbor R2 and
   R3.  The MT field is set to 'S' (SPT-based), SR is R1, and SP is
   10.1.0.0/16.  The message to R2 includes NR as R2 and DR as R5 and
   R6.  The message to R3 includes both NR and DR as R3.  Upon receiving
   R1’s SAV message from link R1-R2, R2 establishes the SAV rule
   <10.1.0.0/16, int.2.1>, indicating that interface 2.1 is the valid
   incoming interface for the prefix 10.1.0.0/16.  Similarly, R3
   establishes the SAV rule <10.1.0.0/16, int.3.1>, indicating that
   interface 3.1 is the valid incoming interface for the prefix.  Since
   the message received by R3 indicates DR as R3 itself, it does not
   need to propagate the message further.  R2, however, needs to
   propagate the message to R5 and R6 according to its local SPT.  R5 is
   directly connected to R2, while R6 is in the subtree of neighbor R4.
   Therefore, R2 generates messages for neighbor R4 and R5, keeping the
   MT, SR, and SP fields unchanged.  R2’s message to R4 includes NR as
   R4 and DR as R6.  R2’s message to R5 includes NR as R5 and DR as R5.
   Upon receiving the message from R2, R4 and R5 establish local SAV
   rules <10.1.0.0/16, int.4.1> and <10.1.0.0/16, int.5.2>,
   respectively.  Similarly, R4 continues to propagate the message to R6
   based on the local SPT, and R6 establishes the SAV rule <10.1.0.0/16,
   int.6.1>.  Thus, all routers on the SPT of R1 can learn the valid
   incoming interfaces for R1’s source prefix.  If a packet with a
   source address within the prefix 10.1.0.0/16 is received on a invalid
   interface, such as R5 receiving a packet at interface 5.1, predefined
   security measures like packet dropping, rate limiting, or traffic
   monitoring may be taken.

           Figure 3: SAV message propagation along the SPT of R1.

   SAV messages are propagated within an area.  SAV messages generated
   by different routers carry different source prefix information based
   on their role.

   If a router is connected to a stub network, it should generate SAV
   messages to protect the prefixes of this stub network from being
   spoofed.  To reduce communication overhead, the router can send a SAV
   message with the SP field set to a specific value.  Routers receiving
   a message with SP set to this specific value use the prefixes of SR's
   stub network stored in the LSDB as source prefixes to be validated.
   They are included in the Router-LSA advertised by SR with link type
   "stub".

   If a router is an ABR or ASBR, it can also generate SAV messages to
   protect the prefixes outside the area from being spoofed.  For an
   ABR, the source prefix announced in a SAV message can be prefixes
   contained in summary-LSAs advertised within the area and prefixes
   contained in AS-external-LSAs received from other areas.  For an
   ASBR, the source prefix announced in a SAV message can be prefixes
   contained in AS-external-LSAs advertised within the area.  To reduce
   communication overhead, an ABR or ASBR can send a SAV message with
   the SP field set to a specific value.  Routers receiving a message
   with SP set to a specific value use prefixes included in the summary-
   LSAs advertised by this ABR or prefixes included in the AS-external-
   LSAs advertised by this ASBR as source prefixes to be validated.

4.2.  SAV Message Propagation considering Policy-based Routing

   Policy-based routing (PBR) is a widely supported feature on modern
   routers.  It enables network administrators to make routing decisions
   based on policies that reflect specific network requirements, rather
   than solely depending on routing tables generated by traditional
   routing protocols.  This capability allows for finer control over
   traffic flows, facilitating decision-making based on criteria such as
   source and destination addresses, specific types of traffic, or even
   application data.  By establishing PBR rules, administrators can
   direct different types of traffic along designated paths, thus
   addressing specific security or Quality of Service (QoS) needs
   effectively.

   In networks where routers are configured with PBR, it is crucial to
   propagate SAV messages not only along the paths determined by the SPT
   but also along paths specified by PBR rules.  This ensures that all
   interfaces a source prefix might reach according to both traditional
   routing protocols and PBR are considered legitimate entry points,
   thereby minimizing the risk of improper blocking of valid traffic.

   Take Figure 2 as an example.  Assume Router R1 has a local PBR rule
   defined as <10.1.1.0/24, 10.5.0.0/16, R3>.  This rule redirects
   traffic from the source IP addresses within 10.1.1.0/24 heading
   towards the stub network connected to R5, to go via R3 instead.  R1
   should generate a SAV message based on this rule and propagate this
   message along link R1-R3 and R3-R5.  This action designates
   interfaces int.3.1 at R3 and int.5.1 at R5 as vaid incoming
   interfaces for the prefix 10.1.1.0/24.

   Similarly, assume Router R2 has a PBR rule which redirects all
   traffic on port 80 going to the subnet 10.6.0.0/16 of R6 towards R5.
   Besides forwarding the SAV message originated from R1 to R6 along the
   SPT, R2 should also send the SAV message through R5 to reach R6 base
   on this PBR rule.  This ensures that int.5.2 at R5 and int.6.2 at R6
   are recognized as valid incoming interfaces for the source prefixes
   of R1.

4.2.1.  SAV Message Generation

   When a router, such as Router R1, is configured with PBR rules that
   direct specific types of traffic to a neighbor (e.g., R2), it is
   essential for R1 to generate SAV messages based on these PBR rules
   and send them to R2.  This enables R2 to permit the corresponding
   traffic through and to continue propagating the SAV information to
   other relevant routers within the domain.  The fields for SAV
   messages generated based on PBR rules are set as follows:

   *  *MT*: Set to 'P' (PBR-based).

   *  *SR*: R1.

   *  *NR*: R2.

   *  *SP*, *DR*, and *DP*: Depend on the type of the PBR rule.  Given
      that SAV messages are primarily concerned with sending which
      source prefixes to which destinations, PBR rules are divided into
      four categories based on the specification of source and
      destination prefixes.  Other parameters in the rules, such as port
      numbers, are represented as 'other' and are not considered in the
      generation of SAV messages.

      1.  *<srcIP, *, other, nexthop>*: This implies that packets with a
          source address belonging to srcIP may reach any router in the
          domain through nexthop R2.  Thus, SP is set to srcIP, while DR
          and DP are not specifically defined.

      2.  *<*, dstIP, other, nexthop>*: This implies that any packet
          from R1 might reach the router associated with dstIP through
          nexthop R2.  Hence, SP is set to a default value representing
          all source prefixes of R1, DP is set to dstIP, and DR is not
          specifically defined.

      3.  *<srcIP, dstIP, other, nexthop>*: This implies that packets
          with a source address belonging to srcIP may reach the router
          associated with dstIP through nexthop R2.  Therefore, SP is
          set to srcIP, DP is set to dstIP, and DR is not specifically
          defined.

      4.  *<*, *, other, nexthop>*: This implies that any packet from R1
          may reach any router in the domain through nexthop R2.  Thus,
          SP is set to a default value representing all source prefixes
          of R1, while DR and DP are not specifically defined.

      For cases where DR and DP are not specifically defined, nexthop R2
      determines the endpoints of the SAV message propagation based on
      local routing policies (see Section 4.2.2).

4.2.2.  SAV Message Forwarding

   When Router R2, configured with PBR rules, receives a SAV message
   from Router R1, it must forward this message along both the SPT paths
   and the paths specified by its PBR rules.  R2 uses the DR and DP
   fields to determine whether it is the endpoint of the message
   propagation.  If not, and the intended neighbor for message
   forwarding is in the same area, the message is forwarded accordingly.
   SR and SP remain unchanged, while NR is updated to the intended
   neighbor.  Other fields are handled as follows:

   *MT:*

   *  If the received message’s MT is 'P' (PBR-based), it remains
      unchanged during forwarding.

   *  If the received message’s MT is 'S' (SPT-based), and the message
      is forwarded based on local PBR rules, MT is changed to 'P'.

   *DR & DP:*

   *  If the received message specifies DP as dstIP:

      1.  Forward the message to the next-hop of dstIP in the Forwarding
          Information Base (FIB), keeping DR and DP unchanged.

      2.  If there is a local PBR rule of type <*, dstIP, other,
          nexthop> or <*, *, other, nexthop>, forward the message to the
          nexthops in these rules, keeping DR and DP unchanged.

   *  If the received message specifies DR:

      -  *Case 1:* If the received message type is 'S':

         1.  Forward the message based on local SPT(see Section 4.1).

         2.  If there is a local PBR rule <*, dstIP, other, nexthop> and
             dstIP belongs to the nodes along the SPT path to DR,
             forward the message to nexthop, updating DP to dstIP,
             leaving DR unspecified.

         3.  If there is a local PBR rule <*, *, other, nexthop>,
             forward the message to nexthop, updating DR to include all
             Router IDs of the nodes along the SPT path to DR, leaving
             DP unspecified.

      -  *Case 2:* If the received message type is 'P':

         1.  Forward the message based on local SPT(see Section 4.1).

         2.  If there is a local PBR rule <*, dstIP, other, nexthop> and
             dstIP belongs to DR, forward the message to nexthop,
             updating DP to dstIP, leaving DR unspecified.

         3.  If there is a local PBR rule <*, *, other, nexthop>,
             forward the message to nexthop, keeping DR and DP
             unchanged.

   *  If the received message does not specify DR and DP:

      1.  Forward the message to all the other neighbors, updating DR to
          include all reachable nodes through these neighbors on SPT,
          leaving DP unspecified.

      2.  If there is a local PBR rule <*, dstIP, other, nexthop>,
          forward the message to nexthop, setting DP to dstIP, leaving
          DR unspecified.

      3.  If there is a local PBR rule <*, *, other, nexthop>, forward
          the message to nexthop, keeping DR and DP unchanged.

   The primary difference between SPT-based and PBR-based SAV messages
   lies in the content of the DR field.  SPT-based messages only record
   SPT leaf nodes since SAV messages are sent along the SPT path to
   these leaf nodes, and intermediate nodes on this path do not need to
   be explicitly listed to receive the message.  This approach reduces
   message length and communication overhead.  In contrast, PBR-based
   messages must record all nodes reachable by the message to ensure
   that it reaches all intended destinations.

   It is important to note that the description provided above outlines
   only the basic logic for the coummunication of SAV messages.  In
   practice, to optimize communication, messages that share the same MT
   and SP fields and are directed to the same NR can be consolidated
   before being sent.

5.  Protocol Extension

5.1.  Extensions to OSPFv2 for SAV Message Propagation

   This document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 to support the
   dissemination of SAV messages via the OSPF protocol.  The extension
   utilizes OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA as defined in [RFC7684].
   The Advertising Router field is utilized to represent the SR within a
   SAV message, which denotes the origin of the SAV message.  The LS
   Type is 10, which is scoped to an area-local visibility.

   The OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA may contain one or more
   Extended Prefix TLVs.  Each TLV is used to carry specific source
   prefix (SP) information pertinent to SAV.  The Address Prefix field
   specifies the IP address of the source prefix.  The Prefix Length
   field indicates the length of the source prefix.

   A new sub-TLV, termed the "Source Prefix Validation Sub-TLV," is
   introduced within the Extended Prefix TLV.  This sub-TLV is designed
   to encapsulate additional fields required for SAV, excluding SR and
   SP, which are already detailed above.  It has the following format:

     0                   1                   2                   3

   An OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV can contain multiple OSPFv2 Source
   Prefix Validation Sub-TLVs, each of which can specify only one NR.
   Routers that receive this TLV process only the Sub-TLV where the NR
   field matches their own Router ID and ignore others.

5.2.  Extensions to OSPFv3 for SAV Message Propagation

   In networks utilizing the OSPFv3 protocol, SAV messages are
   advertised through OSPFv3 Extended LSAs, including E-Intra-Area-
   Prefix-LSA, E-Inter-Area-Prefix-LSA and E-AS-External-LSA [RFC8362].
   The Advertising Router field is used to represent the SR within a SAV
   message.  The Address Prefix and PrefixLength fields of the Intra-
   Area Prefix TLV, Inter-Area Prefix TLV, and External-Prefix TLV are
   used to represent a specific SP.  Additionally, A new OSPFv3 Source
   Prefix Validation sub-TLV is defined to be included in these TLVs to
   carry SAV message fields excluding SR and SP.  The format of this new
   sub-TLV is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3

   Message Type
      0 - the SAV message is based on SPT

  
      1 - the SAV message is based on PBR

   Reserved
      SHOULD be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be ignored on
      reception.

   NR
      The Neighbor Router ID to which the SAV message is sent.

   DR Count
      The number of Destination Router IDs included in this Sub-TLV.

   DP Count
      The number of Destination Prefixes included in this Sub-TLV.

   DR
      Each DR field represents a Destination Router ID to which the SAV
      message is ultimately advertised.  The number of DR fields
      corresponds to the value in the DR Count field.

   DP Length
      Length of a Destination Prefix in bits.

   DP
      Each DP field represents a Destination Prefix to which the message
      is ultimately advertised.  The number of DP fields corresponds to
      the value in the DP Count field.

   An Intra-Area Prefix TLV, Inter-Area Prefix TLV, or External-Prefix
   TLV can contain multiple OSPFv3 Source Prefix Validation Sub-TLVs,
   each specifying only one NR.  Routers receiving the TLV only process
   the Sub-TLV where the NR field matches their own Router ID and ignore
   others.

6.  Automatic Update Considerations

   When network changes occur, routers need to promptly update their SAV
   rules to ensure the accuracy of source address validation.  For Edge
   SAV, Area Border SAV, and AS Border SAV, the SAV rules derived from
   the LSDB can be updated almost in real-time as the LSDB is refreshed.
   For Transit SAV, propagating SAV messages via OSPF flooding ensures
   that all routers in the network can timely receive SAV message
   updates and refresh their SAV rules correspondingly.

   For SAV messages generated based on the SPT, when a router's source
   prefix to be protected changes or SPT changes, the router should
   generate a new SAV message to inform other routers in the network to
   update their SAV rules.  A new SAV rule about prefix p based on this
   message should replace the existing SAV rule about prefix p that was
   generated based on an earlier SPT-type SAV message.

   For SAV messages generated based on PBR rules, if a router adds a new
   PBR rule which redirects traffic with a specified source prefix to a
   next-hop N, it should send a SAV message about this prefix to N.  If
   a router adds a new PBR rule which redirects traffic without a
   specified source prefix to a next-hop N, it should send a SAV message
   about its own prefixes to N, and also forward the SAV messages it
   received from other routers to N based on this rule.  Then N will
   further forward the received messages based on the DR and DP fields
   accordingly, allowing other routers in the network to timely learn
   the new forwarding paths added by PBR.

   It is recommended to set an age field for SAV rules built on PBR-type
   SAV messages.  The age refers to the amount of time that has elapsed
   since the SAV rule was originally generated and gradually increases
   over time.  Periodic sending of SAV messages based on a certain PBR
   rule refreshes the corresponding SAV rules and reset the age field to
   0.  If a PBR-type SAV rule is not refreshed before it reaches Max
   Age, it is considered expired and should be removed from the SAV
   table.

7.  Incremental/Partial Deployment Considerations

   In terms of deployment strategy, it is recommended to deploy Edge SAV
   and AS Border SAV first to block spoofed traffic at the edges of a
   domain.  If Edge SAV cannot be fully deployed within the domain, Area
   Border SAV is recommended to be deployed in multi-area scenarios,
   allowing ABRs to prevent inter-area source address spoofing.  Transit
   SAV is recommended to be deployed in each area to validate spoofed
   source address packets during their forwarding process.  The
   deployment strategy can be adjusted based on the actual performance
   and specific needs of each area.  Start by deploying in critical
   areas ensures that the most sensitive or vulnerable parts of the
   network gain protection early in the deployment process.

   In scenarios where Transit SAV is partially deployed within an area,
   it is suggested to extend the Router Information (RI) LSA [RFC7770]
   to exchange information about each router’s support for Transit SAV.
   Routers that support Transit SAV can proactively advertise SAV
   messages to neighbors that also support Transit SAV, to protect their
   own source prefixes from being spoofed.  Routers receiving SAVNET
   messages can establish SAV rules to block packets coming from
   unauthorized interfaces.  The source prefixes can be better protected
   with more routers within the domain supporting Transit SAV.

   In scenarios where Transit SAV is partially deployed within an area,
   if routers that do not support Transit SAV have enabled PBR, this may
   prevent other routers from getting all the valid incoming interfaces
   for a given source prefix.  In such cases, a flexible traffic
   handling strategy is recommended.  Packets coming from unauthorized
   interfaces are dropped or rate limited only when the traffic is
   clearly abnormal.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations
   beyond those inherent in the existing OSPF protocol implementations.
   The security features already available in OSPF, such as
   authentication mechanisms, can be leveraged to ensure the secure
   transmission of SAV messages.  Utilizing OSPF’s built-in capabilities
   for securing routing information ensures that the integrity and
   authenticity of SAV messages are maintained across the network.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  OSPFv2

   Under "OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV Sub-TLVs registry" as defined in
   [RFC7684], IANA is requested to assign a registry value for OSPFv2
   Source Prefix Validation Sub-TLV as follows:

   +===========+==========================+==================+
   |   Value   |        Description       |     Reference    |
   +===========+==========================+==================+
   |   TBD1    | Source Prefix Validation |   This document  |
   +-----------+--------------------------+------------------+

9.2.  OSPFv3

   Under "OSPFv3 Extended-LSA Sub-TLVs registry" as defined in
   [RFC8362], IANA is requested to assign a registry value for OSPFv3
   Source Prefix Validation Sub-TLV as follows:

   +===========+==========================+==================+
   |   Value   |        Description       |     Reference    |
   +===========+==========================+==================+
   |   TBD2    | Source Prefix Validation |   This document  |
   +-----------+--------------------------+------------------+
